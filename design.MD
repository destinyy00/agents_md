1. Vision & Intent
This website is a proprietary asset designed to provide high-utility Markdown content. The design must reflect "digital craftsmanship"—a fusion of technical precision and aesthetic intentionality. We reject "distributional convergence," the phenomenon where AI-generated designs regress to the internet's statistical mean, in favor of a high-entropy, premium experience.

2. 🚫 The "Anti-Slop" Guardrails (Forbidden Tropes)
To prevent the platform from looking like a generic AI template, the following are strictly prohibited :

No Purple-to-Blue Gradients: Strictly avoid the cliché linear gradients on white or light-gray backgrounds.

No Font Defaults: Do not use Inter, Roboto, Arial, or standard system font stacks for primary UI elements.

No Symmetric 3-Column Grids: Avoid the "three-boxes-with-icons" layout common in commodity SaaS templates.

No 0.1 Opacity Shadows: Do not use the default "subtle" box shadows. Use multi-layered depth or sharp, high-contrast borders instead.

No Centered Hero Blobs: Avoid layouts featuring centered text and a single primary button in a white void.

3. 🎨 Visual System & Aesthetics
3.1 Typography (Semantic Authority)
Typography is our primary trust signal. We prioritize extreme contrast and high-personality typefaces.

Display Headlines: Use an elegant, high-contrast serif like Playfair Display or Editorial New.

Body Text: Use a modern grotesque sans-serif like Bricolage Grotesque or Söhne. Maintain a 1.6x line-height for readability.

Markdown/Code: Use JetBrains Mono. This is non-negotiable for a site that "gives users MD".

Hierarchy: Aim for a 3:1 size ratio between H1 and body text (e.g., 72px for H1 vs 24px for body).

3.2 Color System (IDE-Inspired Restraint)
We use a restricted palette of 3–5 colors maximum to improve brand recognition by up to 80%.

Strategy: Utilize IDE-inspired color schemes (e.g., "VSCode Dark") or "1970s ski lodge" tones (burnt orange, warm browns).

Tokens: All colors must be mapped to semantic CSS variables (e.g., --surface-elevated, --accent-sharp).

Accessibility: Ensure all text/background pairings exceed AAA contrast standards.

3.3 Spatial Composition (Asymmetric Confidence)
Mastery is shown through what is removed. We use ample white space to signal "confident simplicity".

Wide Margins: Use generous page margins (15–20% of the total page width).

Negative Space: Spacing between elements should be 1.5–2x the standard web defaults.

Grid Breaks: Introduce asymmetric layouts or grid-breaking overlaps to prove the design was crafted by a human with visual judgment, not an algorithm.

4. 💫 Interactive Patterns
Interaction should move from "walls of text" to "active participation".

Orchestrated Loads: Use 0.6s cubic-bezier transitions with staggered animation-delay to create a refined page-loading experience.

Optimistic UI: All user actions (like "Copy Markdown") must have sub-100ms response times.

Keyboard-First: Implement a Cmd+K command palette for navigation and search, mirroring the power-user experience of tools like Linear.

5. 📑 Structure & Semantic Purity
Functional Dashboard: The site should not be a passive list of articles but a functional tool that solves the user's problem immediately.

Semantic HTML: Use native landmark elements (<main>, <nav>, <aside>) to ensure speed and SEO visibility.

The "Tidy Drawer" Principle: Use accordions and progressive disclosure to keep information density low while maintaining deep utility.
